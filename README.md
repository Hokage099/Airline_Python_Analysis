# Airline_Python_Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of airline operations and pricing patterns using Python data visualization to uncover insights across flight scheduling, revenue performance, and fare dynamics.
 
Project Overview
This analysis examines airline industry patterns through six key objectives, providing actionable insights into flight operations, scheduling trends, city-wise traffic distribution, revenue performance, and pricing strategies.

1. Flight Frequency Analysis by Airline
Method: Countplot visualization showing flight frequency per airline

Insight: Identified market share and operational volume of each airline company

Visualization: Bar chart displaying total flights operated by each airline

2. Flight Volume by Time Patterns
Method: Analyzed departure and arrival time distributions separately

Insight: Revealed peak operational hours and scheduling patterns

Visualization: Subplot with two bar charts comparing arrival vs departure time volumes

3. City-wise Flight Volume Distribution
Method: Counted flight volumes for both source and destination cities

Insight: Identified major hub cities and traffic distribution patterns

Visualization: Horizontal bar chart subplot showing source and destination city volumes

4. Revenue Performance by Airline
Method: Grouped airlines and aggregated total ticket revenue

Key Finding: Vistara and Air India generated highest revenues due to business class service offerings

Visualization: Pie chart displaying percentage revenue share by airline

5. Price Variation by Route
Method: Analyzed fare differences across source-destination city pairs

Insight: Identified premium and budget routes with pricing trends

Visualization: Line chart subplot for each city showing price variations

<img width="776" height="541" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91bba40f-52fa-453a-9b9e-2f2fe675e48c" />

6. Fare Dynamics vs Booking Time
Method: Examined relationship between ticket prices and days remaining until departure

Insight: Revealed dynamic pricing patterns and optimal booking windows

Visualization: Line chart with days_left vs price correlation
